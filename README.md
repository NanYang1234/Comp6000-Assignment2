# Comp6000-Assignment2

For this Assignment the video on the Canvas is extrmely helpful, Thank you for doing that.
And the difference between the class example and the assignemnt2 is the elements quantities, For insance, On the class example under the item element is only have itemPrice one element, but for the assignment it has two which are itemPrice and itemQty, This is the problem I encounterd when I doing my assignment.
